    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Let $Y$ be the plane curve $y = x^2$ (i.e., $Y$ is the zero set of the polynomial $f = y - x^2$). Show that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.
      \item Let $Z$ be the plane curve $xy = 1$. Show that $A(Z)$ is not isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exercise}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item $y - x^2$ is irreducible, so $I(Y) = (y - x^2)$. Therefore $A(Y) = k[x,y]/(y-x^2) = k[x]$.
      \item Similarly, $A(Z) = k[x,y]/(xy - 1) = k[x, x^{-1}]$. Suppose there existed an isomorphism $\phi: k[x, x^{-1}] \to k[t]$. $x$, $x^{-1}$ and all non-zero elements of $k$ are units in $k[x,x^{-1}]$. Therefore, their images under $\phi$ must be units. However, $k[t]^\times = k \setminus \{0\}$, so there is no element of $k[x, x^{-1}]$ which maps to $t$, since the elements of $k[x, x^{-1}]$ are polynomials in $x$ and $x^{-1}$ and $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism. This contradicts the injectivity of $\phi$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}

  \begin{exercise}
    \emph{The twisted cubic curve.} Let $Y \subseteq \mathbb{A}^3$ be the set $\{ (t, t^2, t^3) : t \in k \}$. Show that $Y$ is an affine variety of dimension $1$. Find generators for the ideal $I(Y)$. Show that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$. We say that $Y$ is given by the \emph{parametric representation} $x = t$, $y = t^2$, $z = t^3$.
  \end{exercise}
  \begin{proof}
    It is easy to verify that $Y = Z(y - x^2, z - x^3)$. Then $A/(y - x^2, z - x^3) = k[x]$, which is a principal ideal domain, so in particular an integral domain, meaning $(y - x^2, z - x^3)$ is prime, so $Y$ is an affine variety. Also, this tells us that $I(Y) = (y - x^2, z - x^2)$ since all prime ideals are radical, so $y - x^2$ and $z - x^2$ are generators for $I(Y)$. We already saw that $A(Y) = A/(y - x^2, z - x^3) = k[x]$. To see that $Y$ has dimension $1$, observe that $\dim A(Y) = \operatorname{trdeg}_k k(x) = 1$.
  \end{proof}
